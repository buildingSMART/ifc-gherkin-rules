ALB001,Alignment-in-spatial-structure,"The rule verifies, that each IfcAlignment is contained in an IfcSite.",True,True,False,ALB
ALB002,Alignment-layout,"This rule verifies that (a) alignment has a nesting relationship with its layout components,(b) its layout components have a nesting relationship with alignment,(c) the layouts must have a nesting relationship with the alignment segments and,(d) each layout direction must be linked to their own respective segments through the attribute DesignParameters",False,True,False,ALB
ALB003,Alignment-directions,"The rule verifies that an Alignment has a nesting relationship with its components (i.e., Horizontal, Vertical, Cant layouts)or with Referents (e.g., mileage markers). And not with any other entity.",False,True,False,ALB
ALB004,Alignment-in-spatial-structure,"The rule verifies, that each IfcAlignment must be related to IfcProject using the IfcRelAggregates relationship - either directly or indirectly. The indirect case is when a child alignment is aggregated to a parent alignment.In this case, only the parent alignment shall be related to the project. Additionally instances of IfcAlignment must not be related to spatial entities using the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship.",False,True,False,ALB

GEM111,No-duplicated-points-within-a-polyloop-or-polyline,"The rule verifies, that all the polyloops and polylines will have no duplicate points, unless it's the first and last point of a closed polyline.In that case, it must be identical by reference (referencing the same instance), not just having the same coordinates.",False,True,False,GEM
GRF001,Identical-coordinate-operations,"The rule verifies that the same coordinate system is used within an IFC model and not, for example, anIfcMapConversion in one representation context and IfcRigidOperation in another.",False,False,False,GRF

SPS004,No_combination_of_containment_and_positioning,"Each IfcProduct can either be contained in one and only one IfcSpatialStructureElement, or contained in one and only one IfcLinearPositioningElement, but not both.",True,True,False,SPS
SPS006,Elements_referenced_in_Spatial_structures,"If IfcElements are positioned wrt IfcPositioning elements, then they must be also referenced (instead of contained) into a IfcSpatialStructure element",True,True,False,SPS
