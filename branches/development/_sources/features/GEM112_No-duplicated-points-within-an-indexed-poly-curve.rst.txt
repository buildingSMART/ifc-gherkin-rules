   004 | Feature: GEM112 - No duplicated points within an indexed poly curve
   005 | The rule verifies that all indexed poly curves will have no duplicate points.
   006 | Two points are considered to be duplicates if the distance between them is less than
   007 | the Precision factor of the applicable geometric context.
   008 | 
   009 |   Scenario: Agreement on no duplicated points within an indexed poly curve
