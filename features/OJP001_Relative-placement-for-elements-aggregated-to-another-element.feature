Feature: OJP001 - Relative placement for elements aggregated to another element
The rule verifies that if an IfcElement is a part of another IfcElement (the container) through the relationship
IfcRelAggregates, then the relative placement of that IfcElement shall be provided by an IfcLocalPlacement
with an PlacementRelTo attribute pointing to the IfcLocalPlacement of the container element.

  Scenario: Agreement on the relative placement of IfcElements being a part of another IfcElement through the relationship IfcRelAggregates

      Given A file with Schema Identifier "IFC2X3"
      And An IfcElement
      And A relationship IfcRelAggregates from IfcElement to IfcElement
      Then The relative placement of that IfcElement must be provided by an IfcLocalPlacement entity
      And The PlacementRelTo attribute must point to the IfcLocalPlacement of the container element established with IfcRelAggregates relationship
