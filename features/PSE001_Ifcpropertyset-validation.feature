    Scenario: Agreement on each IfcPropertySet correctly defining an applicable entity.

      Given A file with Schema "IFC2X3"

      Then The IfcPropertySet Name attribute value must use predefined values according to the IFC2x3_definitions.csv table
      Then The IfcPropertySet must be assigned according to the property set definitions table IFC2x3_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty must be named according to the property set definitions table IFC2x3_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty must be of type according to the property set definitions table IFC2x3_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty value must be of data type according to the property set definitions table IFC2x3_definitions.csv


    Scenario: Agreement on each IfcPropertySet correctly defining an applicable entity.

      Given A file with Schema "IFC4"

      Then The IfcPropertySet Name attribute value must use predefined values according to the IFC4_definitions.csv table
      Then The IfcPropertySet must be assigned according to the property set definitions table IFC4_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty must be named according to the property set definitions table IFC4_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty must be of type according to the property set definitions table IFC4_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty value must be of data type according to the property set definitions table IFC4_definitions.csv


    Scenario: Agreement on each IfcPropertySet correctly defining an applicable entity.

      Given A file with Schema "IFC4X3"
      Then The IfcPropertySet Name attribute value must use predefined values according to the IFC4X3_definitions.csv table
      Then The IfcPropertySet must be assigned according to the property set definitions table IFC4X3_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty must be named according to the property set definitions table IFC4X3_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty must be of type according to the property set definitions table IFC4X3_definitions.csv
      Then Each associated IfcProperty value must be of data type according to the property set definitions table IFC4X3_definitions.csv
