   | '
   | Given its attribute X must start with Y or Z
   | '
   | Is almost the same as
   | '
   | Given its attribute X
   | Its value must start with Y or Z
   | '
   | 
   | However, when navigating the context stack and there is a subsequent step,
   | it is sometimes preferable to include the statement within a single step.
   | 
   | For example;
   | '
   | (1)Given an entity IfcBuildingStorey
   | (2)Given its attribute X must start with Y or Z
   | (3)Given its relating Wall
   | (4)Then Some condition
   | '
   | In this case, it is challenging to split step (2) into two separate steps and then return to the
   | relating Wall (step 3) of the entity in step (1). This is because the instances in the context will be
   | the content of the attribute X of IfcBuildingStorey rather than the storey itself."
