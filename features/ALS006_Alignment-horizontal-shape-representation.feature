Feature: ALS006 - Alignment horizontal shape representation
The rule verifies that IfcAlignmentHorizontal is represented correctly with representation type Curve2D and representation item either IfcCompositeCurve or IfcIndexedPolycurve or IfcPolyline.

  Background:
    Given A model with Schema "IFC4.3"
    Given An IfcAlignmentHorizontal
    Given Its attribute Representation
    Given Its attribute Representations

  @E00020
  Scenario: Agreement on each IfcAlignmentHorizontal using correct representation - Value

    Then The value of attribute RepresentationIdentifier must be Axis
    Then The value of attribute RepresentationType must be Curve2D


  @E00010
  Scenario: Agreement on each IfcAlignmentHorizontal using correct representation - Type

    Then  The type of attribute Items must be IfcCompositeCurve or IfcIndexedPolycurve or IfcPolyline
