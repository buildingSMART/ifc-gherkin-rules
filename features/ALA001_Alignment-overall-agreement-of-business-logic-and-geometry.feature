Feature: ALA001 - Alignment overall agreement of business logic and geometry
  The rule verifies that when an Alignment has both business logic and geometry (representation), the representation entity type must correspond to the layouts present in the business logic.

Background: Validating overall agreement on presence of cant in business logic
  Given A model with Schema "IFC4.3"
  Given An IfcAlignment

Scenario: Validating the presence of cant layout for IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve
  Then  A representation by IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve requires the presence of IfcAlignmentCant in the business logic

Scenario: Validating the presence of vertical layout for IfcGradientCurve
  Then  A representation by IfcGradientCurve requires the presence of IfcAlignmentVertical in the business logic

Scenario: Validating the presence of vertical layout for 3D IfcIndexedPolyCurve
  Then A representation by 3D IfcIndexedPolyCurve requires the presence of IfcAlignmentVertical in the business logic

Scenario: Validating the presence of vertical layout for 3D IfcPolyline
  Then A representation by 3D IfcPolyline requires the presence of IfcAlignmentVertical in the business logic

Scenario: Validating the absence of vertical and cant layout for IfcCompositeCurve as Axis
  Then A representation by IfcCompositeCurve as Axis requires the absence of IfcAlignmentVertical and IfcAlignmentCant in the business logic

Scenario: Validating the absence of cant layout for IfcGradientCurve
  Then A representation by IfcGradientCurve requires the absence of IfcAlignmentCant in the business logic
