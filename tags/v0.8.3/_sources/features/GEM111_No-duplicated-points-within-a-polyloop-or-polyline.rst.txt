   004 | Feature: GEM111 - No duplicated points within a polyloop or polyline
   005 | The rule verifies, that all the polyloops and polylines will have no duplicate points, unless it's the first and last point of a closed polyline.
   006 | In that case, it must be identical by reference (referencing the same instance), not just having the same coordinates.
   007 | Two points are considered to be duplicates if the distance between them is less than
   008 | the Precision factor of the applicable geometric context.
