Feature: ALS007 - Alignment vertical shape representation
The rule verifies that IfcAlignmentVertical is represented correctly with representation type Curve3D and representation item IfcGradientCurve.

  Background:
    Given A model with Schema "IFC4.3"
    Given An IfcAlignmentVertical
    Given Its attribute Representation
    Given Its attribute Representations

  @version3
  @E00010
  Scenario: Agreement on each IfcAlignmentVertical using correct representation - Type

    Given its attribute Items
    Then  The type must be "IfcGradientCurve"

  @E00020
  Scenario: Agreement on each IfcAlignmentVertical using correct representation - Value

      Given its attribute RepresentationIdentifier
      Then The value must be "Axis"


  @E00020
  Scenario: Agreement on each IfcAlignmentVertical using correct representation - Type

      Given its attribute RepresentationType
      Then The value must be "Curve3D"
