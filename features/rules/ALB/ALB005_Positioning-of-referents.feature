Feature: ALB005 - Positioning of referents
The rule verifies that IfcReferents (typed POSITION or STATION) linked to IfcAlignments need a IfcRelPositions relationship

  Scenario: Agreement on each IfcAlignment being aggregated to IfcProject and not contained in IfcSpatialElement

      Given A model with Schema "IFC4.3"
      Given An IfcReferent
      Given PredefinedType = 'POSITION' or 'STATION'

      Then It must be positioned to IfcAlignment directly
