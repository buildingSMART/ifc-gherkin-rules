Point,2 or 3 dimensional point(s)
PointCloud,3 dimensional points prepresented by a point list
Curve,2 or 3 dimensional curve(s)
Curve2D,2 dimensional curve(s)
Curve3D,3 dimensional curve(s)
Surface,2 or 3 dimensional surface(s)
Surface2D, 2 dimensional surface(s) (a region on ground view)
Surface3D,3 dimensional surface(s)
FillArea,2D region(s) represented as a filled area (hatching)
Text,text defined as text literals
AdvancedSurface,3 dimensional b-spline surface(s)
GeometricSet,points, curves, surfaces (2 or 3 dimensional)
GeometricCurveSet,points, curves (2 or 3 dimensional)
Annotation2D,points, curves (2 or 3 dimensional), hatches and text (2 dimensional)
SurfaceModel,face based and shell based surface model(s), or tessellated surface model(s)
Tessellation,tessellated surface representation(s) only
SolidModel,including swept solid, Boolean results and Brep bodies; more specific types are:
SweptSolid,swept area solids, by extrusion and revolution, excluding tapered sweeps
AdvancedSweptSolid,swept area solids created by sweeping a profile along a directrix, and tapered sweeps
Brep,faceted Brep's with and without voids
AdvancedBrep,Brep's based on advanced faces, with b-spline surface geometry, with and without voids
CSG,Boolean results of operations between solid models, half spaces and Boolean results
Clipping,Boolean differences between swept area solids, half spaces and Boolean results
BoundingBox,simplistic 3D representation by a bounding box
SectionedSpine,cross section based representation of a spine curve and planar cross sections. It can represent a surface or a solid and the interpolations of the between the cross sections is not defined
LightSource,light source with (depending on type) position, orientation, light colour, intensity and attenuation
MappedRepresentation,representation based on mapped item(s), referring to a representation map. Note: it can be seen as an inserted block reference. The shape representation of the mapped item has a representation type declaring the type of its representation items.
