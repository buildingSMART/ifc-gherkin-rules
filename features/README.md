## 1. Branch creation

In the buildingSMART [GitHub repository containing all rules](https://github.com/buildingSMART/ifc-gherkin-rules), create the branch that will be used to develop the new rule.

- Give the branch a meaningful name
- Add 1 rule per branch, to facilitate review (1 rule = 1 `.feature` file)

## 2. Rule development

A rule is considered complete when it has:

- a Gherkin [**feature file**](#21-write-feature-files-gherkin-rules-for-ifc)
- corresponding python implementation (aka, [**python steps**](#22-write-python-steps))
- a set of [**unit test files**](#23-write-unit-test-files)

Below are instructions for all these 3 components.

### 2.1) Write feature files (gherkin rules) for IFC 
A feature file is a file, written using Gherkin syntax, describing the rule behavior.
In the branch just created, add a Gherkin feature file following these instructions.

**File format**: `.feature`

**Location**: https://github.com/buildingSMART/ifc-gherkin-rules/tree/main/features


#### Naming convention for feature files
- The file name is rule code_rule title
- The rule code is made of 3 digits capital letters (taken from the list of [Functional parts](./Functional-parts.md)) + 3 digits number
- The rule code, and rule title, must be unique
- The rule title shall have no space and shall use `-` as separator

<details><summary>wrong</summary>

```
SPS001 - Basic-spatial-structure-for-buildings.feature
SPS001_Basic spatial structure for buildings.feature
SPS001 - Basic spatial structure for buildings.feature
```
</details>
<details><summary>right</summary>

```
SPS001_Basic-spatial-structure-for-buildings.feature
```
</details>

#### Mandatory content
`.feature` files:
- must start with a tag to the functional part. See [Functional parts](./Functional-parts.md)
- must include exactly 1 Feature
- the naming convention for the Feature is the following: rule code - rule title (the same used for the file name). For the rule title blank spaces must be used instead of `-` 

<details><summary>wrong</summary>

```
Feature: ALB001_Alignment Layout

Given ...
Then ...
```
```
@ALB
Feature: ALB001_Alignment-Layout

Given ...
Then ...
```
```
@ALB
Feature: ALB001 - Alignment-Layout

Given ...
Then ...
```

</details>
<details><summary>right</summary>

```
@ALB
Feature: ALB001 - Alignment Layout

Given ...
Then ...
```
</details>

#### Mandatory Given(s)
If the rule in the feature file applies only to specific IFC version(s) and/or View Definition(s), then the feature file (or each of its Scenarios, if it has more than one) must start with Given steps specifying the applicability of the following steps

<details><summary>examples</summary>

```
Given A file with Schema Identifier "IFC2X3"
And A file with Model View Definition "CoordinationView"
```
```
Given A file with Schema Identifier "IFC2X3" or "IFC4"
And A file with Model View Definition "CoordinationView" or "ReferenceView"
```
</details>

#### Optional content
`.feature` files:
- can include 1 or more Scenarios
- Scenario titles have no constraints

#### No spaces between steps

Given a file with Schema Identifier "IFC4X3"

Then Each IfcAlignmentHorizontal must be nested only by 1 IfcAlignment

```
</details>

#### Do not use punctuation at the end of the steps

Then Each IfcAlignmentHorizontal must be nested only by 1 IfcAlignment
And Each IfcAlignmentVertical must be nested only by 1 IfcAlignment
And Each IfcAlignmentCant must be nested only by 1 IfcAlignment
```

<details><summary>right</summary>

```

#### Must vs Shall
Use **must**, not **shall** to impose requirements.
"Shall" is ambiguous, also in the legal field the community is moving to a strong preference for “must” as the clearest way to express a requirement or obligation.

```
Given A file with Schema Identifier "IFC2X3"
And A file with Model View Definition "CoordinationView"
Then There shall be exactly 1 IfcSite element(s)
```

<details><summary>right</summary>

```
Given A file with Schema Identifier "IFC2X3"
And A file with Model View Definition "CoordinationView"
Then There must be exactly 1 IfcSite element(s)
```
</details>

#### Verbs for IFC relationships
When a rule requires a specific IFC relationship to exist, refer to the table below for the right verb to be used.

| IFC relationship       | Verb for rules        | Examples                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IfcRelAggregates       | aggregate, aggregates | Then IfcSite must aggregate IfcBuilding                            |
| IfcRelNests            | nest, nests           | Then Each IfcAlignmentVertical nests a list of IfcAlignmentSegment |
| ...                    |                       |










### 2.2) Write python steps 
The python steps are the implementation (using python language) of the Gherkin grammar used in the feature files.
In the same branch used for the Gherkin rules, change or add python steps following these instructions.

**File format**: `.py`

**Location**: https://github.com/buildingSMART/ifc-gherkin-rules/tree/main/features/steps


#### Naming convention for python files
For the moment, all python steps are contained in [steps.py](https://github.com/buildingSMART/ifc-gherkin-rules/blob/main/features/steps/steps.py). Therefore, **you should not create a new python file, just expand the existing one.**

:construction: :construction: :construction:
*In the future, when this file grows, python steps may be splitted in more files - using a certain criteria (e.g., functional parts). When this will be the case, the instruction will be: locate the best .py file to host your steps and start adding your steps*

#### Steps parametrisation
When creating a new step, think about parametrisation and optimisation of the step for future uses.

#### Step re-use
Before creating a new step, check if something similar already exist.
Try to reuse existing steps.

#### Do not use "when" keyword
The "when" keyword must not be used.
Allowed keywords are: `Given`, `Then`, `And`, `*`

#### Use of existing IfcOpenShell APIs
Try not to use existing IfcOpenShell APIs.









### 2.3) Write unit test files 
Unit test files are atomic IFC files, created to develop a rule and test its behavior.
In the same branch used for the Gherkin rules, and python steps, create unit test files following these instructions. **IMPORTANT**: every rule developed must have a set of unit test files.

**File format**: `.ifc`

**Location**: https://github.com/buildingSMART/ifc-gherkin-rules/tree/main/test/files

- in the test/files folder, create a subfolder using the rule code (E.g., ALB001)
- add the set of unit test files for that rule in this subfolder

#### Naming convention for unit test files files
Unit test files must follow this naming convention

`Expected result`-`rule code`-`rule scenario`-`short_informative_description`.ifc

Or in case where a rule has no scenarios
`Expected result`-`rule code`-`short_informative_description`.ifc

<details><summary>Examples</summary>

```
pass-alb001-short_informative_description.ifc
fail-alb001-scenario01-short_informative_description.ifc
fail-alb001-short_informative_description.ifc
```
</details>


#### Content of the unit tests subfolder
The unit test subfolder must contain: 
- all unit test files (.ifc)
- a README file (.md), listing the files and their expected behavior. Using the [template table](#table-template-for-unit-test-files) below
- where used, the script (.py) created to generate the unit test files 


#### Number of unit tests required
- Each rule developed must have a set of unit test files
- There must be at least 1 fully compliant unit test file
- Fail files must cover all scenarios of the rule


#### Table template for unit test files
Example table describing unit test expected results

| File name                                             | Expected result | Error log                                                                        | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pass-alb002-alignment-layout                          | success         | n.a.                                                                             |                                                                                  |
| fail-alb002-scenario01-nested_attributes_IfcAlignment | fail            | The instance IfcAlignment is nesting two instances of IfcAlignmentHorizontal ... | Error is descriptive or exactly the error in pytest? If exactly, multiple row... |
| fail-alb002-scenario02-two_alignments                 | fail            | The following 2 instances were encountered: IfcAlignment #23, IfcAlignment #906  | For IfcAlignmentHorizontal, IfcAlignmentVertical and IfcAlignmentCant            |
| fail-alb002-scenario03-no_direction                   | fail            | The instance #906=IfcAlignment is nesting #907=IfcWall                           | Includes errors for scenario 2                                                   |
| fail-alb002-scenario04-alignment_segments             | fail            | The instance (s) #28=IfcAlignmentHorizontal is assigned to #906=IfcWall          | @todo IfcAlignmentVertical, IfcAlignmentCant. As well as empty list/typo's?      |
