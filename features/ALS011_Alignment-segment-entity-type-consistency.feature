Feature: ALS011 - Alignment segment entity type consistency

  The rule verifies that the same entity type is used for all segments
  and that IfcCurveSegment is used with IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve and IfcGradientCurve

Scenario Outline: Consistent entity types used

  Given an <entity>
  Given its attribute Segments
  Given its entity type

  Then The values must be identical at depth 1

  Examples:
    | entity |
    | IfcCompositeCurve |
    | IfcGradientCurve  |
    | IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve |


Scenario Outline: IfcCurveSegment used for IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve and IfcGradientCurve

  Given an <entity>
  Given its attribute Segments
  Given its entity type

  Then The value must be "IfcCurveSegment"

  Examples:
    | entity |
    | IfcGradientCurve  |
    | IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve |
